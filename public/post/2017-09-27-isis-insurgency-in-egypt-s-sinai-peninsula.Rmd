The Egyptian military has struggled to maintain control of the Sinai Peninsula since the Egyptian revolution in 2011. The insurgency originally consisted Bedouin tribesmen, a nomadic group living in the desert regions of North Africa. The group has made multiple attacks upon the Egyptian military but have yet to claim allegiance to any specific group. Since 2014, a second insurgency known as Ansar Bait al-Maqdis, a jihadist extremist militant group, has claimed territory in the region and pledged allegiance to the Islamic State. Previously, the group had focused primarily upon Israel and the gas pipeline to Jordan.

Over the past few months the Islamic State has made a number attacks on civilian and military targets. [In April](https://www.haaretz.com/middle-east-news/egypt/1.784140) ISIS militants attacked a police checkpoint near Saint Catherine's Monastery in the Sinai Peninsula. Armed gunmen opened fire upon the checkpoint killing one police officer and wounding four others. Only three months later, in July, ISIS carried out another attack on a remote Egyptian military outpost in the Sinai Peninsula. The ISIS affiliated group used both suicide car bombs and heavy machine gun fire in the assault. The attack left 23 Egyptian soldiers dead, making it the [deadliest attack in the region](http://www.foxnews.com/world/2017/07/08/isis-claims-attack-in-egypts-sinai-that-killed-23-soldiers.html) over the past two years.

Along with the attacks upon Egyptians in the region, the Islamic State has begun [instituting Islamist rule.](http://www.jpost.com/Middle-East/ISIS-Threat/ISIS-grip-on-Egypts-northern-Sinai-widens-seeks-to-impose-Islamist-laws-489529) The group is attempting to impose a strict interpretation of Islamic law upon the local population. This "morality police force", known as Hisba, has begun implementing rules against activities such as smoking, men shaving beards, and allowing women to expose their faces. This is the first time ISIS has attempted to enforce its laws upon the people of Egypt.
