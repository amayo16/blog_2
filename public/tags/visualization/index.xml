      <description>Interactive BarplotsPreviously, we showed how to do basic barplots. Today we will use ggiraph in order to change our barplot to an interactive bar plot.
We begin by loading in the necessary packages.
library(Lahman)library(dplyr)library(ggplot2)library(ggiraph)Then we will query the data and order it by most homeruns, similar to last time.
df &amp;lt;- Teams%&amp;gt;%filter(yearID == 1980)%&amp;gt;%select(name , HR)%&amp;gt;%arrange(HR)df$name &amp;lt;- factor(df$name, levels = df$name)Now we will put the data into our plot.</description>

      <description>HistogramsA histogram is an accurate graphical representation of the distribution of numberical data. It takes one group of numerical data and places it along the x-axis seperating it into bins. This allows the researcher to do initial analysis to see how the data is distributed.
For this example we will need these packages:
library(Lahman)library(dplyr)library(ggplot2)library(ggiraph)Now that we have the packages loaded in we want to query the database to select what data we want to visualize.</description>

      <description>A scatterplot is a graph in which the values of two variables are plotted along the two axes. This type of graphic is very important when looking for correlations between variables.
Letâ€™s begin by loading that packages that we will need. For this example we will be using the Lahman database which contains baseball statistics going back over 100 years.
library(Lahman)library(dplyr)library(ggiraph)library(ggplot2)In this scatterplot we are going to compare the number of career homeruns hit to the number of strikeouts.</description>
